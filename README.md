# ic-tellurian

Tellurian is a mod for Impossible Creatures which we hope will:

1) Balance IC, so that as many stock creatures are as useful as possible.

2) Fill out the IC genetic library with new, interesting stock creatures that are useful without being overpowered.

3) Provide a whole new experience without sacrificing the fundamental feel of IC.

4) Introduce modelling and modding techniques which have never before been available to anyone besides the Impossible Creatures developers themselves.

5) Be continually updated, and improved, so that no creatures remain overpowered or "abused" for long.
