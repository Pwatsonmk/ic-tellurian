# Impossible Creatures: Tellurian

Tellurian is a mod for Impossible Creatures which adds new stock creatures and includes significant balance changes, which have greatly increased the variety of creatures and strategies which are viable to use in-game. This provides a whole new gameplay experience.

Tellurian can be downloaded from [Moddb](https://www.moddb.com/mods/tellurian) or the [Steam workshop](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=655968653).

## Tellurian over time

This repository aims to provide a history of the balance changes that have gone into Tellurian over time. This will allow us to visualise these changes in a way that can help to guide future development and provide transparency to the community on what is being changed in each release.

It focuses on the .lua files, as these are the key components which control the gameplay balance and can be helpfully compared line-by-line. Other binary files are excluded as they cannot be compared in a useful manner.

A base version of the Impossible Creatures and Impossible Creatures: Insect Invasion .lua files are provided here to form a starting point to compare our balance changes against. To compare these base versions or any version of Tellurian, visit the Releases section.
